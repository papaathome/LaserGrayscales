# How to contribute

Please read these guidelines before contributing to LaserGrayscales:

 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 - [Submitting a Pull Request](#pullrequest)
 - [Contributor License Agreement](#cla)


## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

If you have questions about how to use LaserGrayscales, please read the
[LaserGrayscales documentation][documentation] or start a thread in the Discussions.

GitHub Discussions are primarly for [reporting bugs](#issue) and [feature requests](#feature), not
questions or help.


## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by
submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a 
Pull Request with a fix.

Finding language mistakes in the documentation is more than likely. The documentation was 
writen by a non-native speaker and no proof reading has been done (yet) except by you.
If you have suggestions or corrections please take into account that the Queen's Englisch
(or Britsh English, UK) is preferred above the President's English (US) on the premise that
one must make a choice. Also true for non-native speakers that can hardly keep up appearances.

When submitting an issue please include the following information:

- A description of the issue
- The LaserGrayscales code related to the issue
- The exception message and stacktrace if an error was thrown
- If possible, please include code that reproduces the issue. Use the Discussions for short code
samples, or you could [submit a pull request](#pullrequest) with the issue reproduced in a new test.

The more information you include about the issue, the more likely it is to be fixed!


## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository][github]. Before
requesting a feature consider the following:

- Relevance is important. If you can substantiate your request with CNC or conversion related
arguments then acceptance is more likely.
- Stability is important. (Potential) users expect LaserGrayscales to be reliable and stable.
Huge changes will take more time to consider and realise.
- Time is a scarse commodity. This is a project done is spare time. If you can support your
feature with a [pull request](#pullrequest) and/or a solid discussion acceptance is more likely.


## <a name="pullrequest"></a> Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request to the [GitHub Repository][github] make sure to do the following:

- Check that new and updated code follows LaserGrayscales's existing code formatting and naming standard
- Run your changed version of LaserGrayscales (unit tests not yet available) to ensure no existing 
functionality has been affected.
- It would be hugely appreciated if you write new unit tests to test your changes.
All features and fixed bugs should have tests to verify they work

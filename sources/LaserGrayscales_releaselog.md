LaserGrayscales Release Log
===========================


LaserGrayscales is a tool to test the effects of your laser at power levels 1 through 255 at speeds ranging from 1 mm/s to 70 mm/s or 60 mm/min to 4200 mm/min. This is a good way to see how your laser will react to different materials at different speeds and power levels.

While it is possible to generate test code for each step, in power and speed, this will generate a file of about 16 KB, using an area of 28 by 14 cm (11 by 5 1/2 inch) and a run time of about one hour.

Another approach is to generate an general overview in large steps to find corse location of the ideal spot and then zoom in on a smaller area with finer steps. This will save a lot of time and material.

With LaserGrayscales both approaches are possible. For more details see the LaserGrayscales manual.

In this file details about released versions and the development path for LaserGrayscales is given.
